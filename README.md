It's a app which fetches the movies data from "Movies DB" and list the movies. On clicking each movie, the user can view the plot and vote average and release date.

To use, create a API key from https://developers.themoviedb.org/3 and specify the API key in gradle.properties file using
API_KEY = "your_api_key"
